|Main Menu|The main menu is printed out when the program is first run      |  
+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+  
|1.run    |-Executes the program that is currently loaded                  |  
|2.step   |-Steps through the current program step by step                 |  
|3.menu   |-Reprints the menu on the screen                                |  
|4.reset  |-resets the VM                                                  |  
|5.load   |-Loads a .txt file(Note: test.txt is loaded on startup of the VM|  
|6.exit   |-Quits the VM, and closes the window                            |

|Output   |This VM outputs several .txt files when a program is executed   |  
|Files    |                                                                |  
+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+  
|code.txt |-The VM generates code for the code for the code that supplied  |  
|log.txt  |-The Log is the log of the PC, BP, SP, the stack, & the OP Code |  
+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+  
|How to use:                                                               |  
|test.txt is loaded as soon as the VM is started. if you want to use a     |  
|different text file, it must be loaded using load. use run to run the     |  
|program, and then look at the log.txt to see how the program ran, trace   |  
|the stack, PC, BP, and SP.+-----------------------------------------------+  
+--------------------------+  
|Not all of the operations have been tested (OPR #, #)
|some of the might not work correctly, but the ones that are used
|by the programs given for examples in class do work, and the other ones
|might need minor logic changes only.  
|The Log file is apended each time a program is run, and time stamped.  
|The VM automatically loads test.txt, use load to load another .txt file.
